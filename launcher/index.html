		<h1>Kulinda's Guild Wars 2 Launcher</h1>
		<h2>In five easy steps</h2>

		<h3>Preamble</h3>
		In the patch of January 22nd, 2019, arena.net removed the -email and -password command line arguments,
		making it a bit more tricky to log into multiple accounts.<br />
		<br />
		But there is a different way to auto-login into multiple accounts. The game already has an auto-login feature, which stores the credentials of your previously used account in a file called Local.dat. By keeping multiple versions of this file, and copying them around before starting Guild Wars 2, we can achieve auto-login with multiple accounts.<br />
		<br />
		Note: This will NOT allow you to run multiple accounts at the same time. This is NOT for multiboxing!<br />
		<br />

		<h3>Step 1: Prepare a folder somewhere</h3>

		Just put it anywhere, Desktop or Documents is fine. Give it any name you like.

		<h3>Step 2: Get the batch file</h3>
		Download <a href="run_gw2.bat" target="_blank">run_gw2.bat</a> into the newly created folder.

		<h3>Step 3: Configure the batch file</h3>
		Edit the batch file:<br />

		At the top, change the path to whereever you installed Guild Wars 2:<br />
		<img src="step_3b.png" /><br />
		At the bottom, change the launch options if you like. -autologin is required, the other two are optional. You can find a list of <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments" target="_blank">Command Line Arguments</a> on the wiki.<br />

		<br />
		While you're looking at the file, make sure you understand what it does, and double-check that there's nothing malicous.

		<h3>Step 4: Create one shortcut per account</h3>
		Right-click the run_gw2.bat again, select "Create Shortcut". Then right-click the shortcut, select "Properties".<br />
		<img src="step_4.png" /><br />
		In the Target field, append a space, then a name for your account. Mine are named A, B, C..., but feel free to use more descriptive names.<br />
		Optionally click "Change Icon", browse for the Gw2.exe, and select its icon.<br />
		Move the shortcut where you want it, or pin it to the taskbar.<br />
		<h3>Step 5: Run Guild Wars 2</h3>
		Run the shortcut. Enter your login data, check that account name and password are remembered, and log in. The next time you tun this shortcut, you will login automatically.<br />
		<br />
		Repeat steps 4 and 5 once for each account.<br />
		<h3>Bonus Step: Enjoy the game</h3>
		And make sure that everyone else gets to enjoy the game as well. Be excellent to each other.<br />
