		<p>I finally made time to do some overdue updates. Previously, the site was just a collection of independent projects, with no common layout or site structure. I wanted to integrate them, both technically and visually. And while I was touching everything, I made some upgrades along the way.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h3 id="dye-browser">Dye Browser</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://kulinda.github.io/dyes/">Dye Browser</a> now allows you to load screenshots to find some matching dyes. That should make it a lot easier to find something matching your weapon, your skin color or your favourite scenery.</p>
<p>For best results, make screenshots in a well-lit area.</p>
<h3 id="mount-adoption-helper">Mount Adoption Helper</h3>
<p>Even though the <a href="https://kulinda.github.io/mounts/">Mount Adoption Helper</a> has been less useful since the introduction of Select Licenses, I've updated it to include the recent packs anyway.</p>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>This site now has a blog. Where? You're reading it right now! It has a <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>, if you wish to be notified about further releases and updates.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>Doesn't look much different though. Mostly, I added a global menu to the top left, making it easier to navigate between all of the different projects. If you were wondering who Kulinda actually is: that's her, right there. Kulinda Secondborn, my Sylvari Guardian.</p>
