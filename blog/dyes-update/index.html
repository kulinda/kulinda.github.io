		<p>In an unrelated project, I encountered the <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">oklab color space</a>, and I thought to myself: Huh, this might be useful in <a href="https://kulinda.github.io/dyes/">my dye browser</a> to find better matching dyes.</p>
<p>So I dug into the code to implement it. And I couldn't stop myself and gave the everything a good overhaul.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>After dedusting the code from 2018 and updating the toolchain and the dependencies, I started implementing the oklab formulas. In an extensive user study (n = 2), we agreed that oklab produced slightly better colors than a simple RGB comparison, most of the time.</p>
<p>I also added <a href="https://kulinda.github.io/dyes/#map">a color map</a>, which (thanks to the oklab color space) looks a lot better than the hue circles you usually see. And I greatly extended <a href="https://kulinda.github.io/dyes/#faq">the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>But I have grown professionally in the last 3.5 years, and I just couldn't bear to see this old shoddy work. I managed to stop myself from rewriting everything in TypeScript, but I did redo the whole layout, parts of the user workflow, and I converted a couple of components into modern React functional components.</p>
<p>But now I got to stop playing around and actually publish this thing.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy, and I'm looking forward to all the new character styles I'll see on the expansion!</p>
